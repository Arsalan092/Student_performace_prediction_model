# Student Performance Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts student scores based on study habits and performance metrics like hours studied, practice time, teamwork, midterm, and final exam scores using a linear regression model.

## Key Features
- Dataset includes various student attributes impacting overall scores.
- Data is split into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.
- Linear Regression applied for predicting continuous target variable (scores).
- Model evaluation with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.
- Visual comparison of true vs predicted scores across features using scatter plots with regression lines.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Results
The model provides transparent predictions of student scores with visual insights into feature relationships, helping understand the impact of various factors on academic performance.
